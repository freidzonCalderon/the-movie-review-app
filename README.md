# The Movie Review Application

## [Live Demo Click Here](https://the-movie-review-app.netlify.app/).

This project was the final assignment for the React JS course at UCenfotec, where I demonstrated the practical skills I acquired during my web development journey. I used React JS and Bootstrap to create a user-friendly and responsive application that works flawlessly on any device. Whether you use a laptop, desktop, tablet, or smartphone, you can enjoy the same smooth performance and functionality on all of them. This makes our application universally accessible and appealing. I also used Tailwind, Axios, and Firebase to enhance the design, data fetching, and storage capabilities of the application.

### Technologies used: React JS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Axios, and Firebase

### Description of the Application

It is a movie review website that lets you create your own personal account, as it uses Firebase authentication system; or you could simply log in with your existing account. Once you are logged in, you can browse through a variety of movies and rate them with a 5-star system. You can also add your favorite movies to your personal list and access them anytime. My application is designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and secure.

To get started, you can create your own account by clicking on the "Sign Up" button. If you prefer to use pre-built information. Simply use the following data to access the application without creating an account.
